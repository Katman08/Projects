This script was made for fun and practice.

It pulls a random image posted to www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper or www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers, pastes a picture of a bird of the appropriate resolution in the bottom right corner, then activates a batch script that attempts to force the desktop to refresh. 

Examples of images generatered can be found in the the example folder.
