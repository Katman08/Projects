The files in this folder were created by me and one other person as tools for a cyberpatriot competition.
The goal for all of them is to patch common security flaws in windows 10 and windows server.

Each major change has been separated into a separate file in the following order.

Augustus.bat - First working script

Augustus.ps1 - Converted to powershell

AugustusFunc.ps1 - Reorginized code into functions

AugustusGUI.ps1 - Created GUI
