The files here were created as way for me to learn how to create a discord bot. The features in the newest version include:

1. Pull and send x number of random images from either imgur or printsc
2. Announce when a user joins/leaves a voice channel using tts (includes user nickname)
3. Basic soundboard with ~10 effects
4. Basic music bot functions
--finds first youtube result for input song name
--downloads song as mp3 and plays in voice channel
--if a song is requested while the bot is already playing, it is added to a queue and played after
5. If the bot is in a voice channel with no non-bot users, it will find which vc has the most users and switch to that channel
