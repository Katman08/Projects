This game was created as a way for me to explore 3d imaging and network managing. It is not complete and has many bugs, but functions.

Ideally, it allows the user to create either a host or a server, and join another server by inputing its IP.

It also supports a single player mode.

All scripts were custom coded in c# including the following:

1. 3d wasd movement with sprint and realistic jumping
2. Multi directional camera control
3. Infinite chunk based terrain generation

This folder contains all scripts for single player and multiplayer modes, a completed build, and the unity file.
